## 🌟 Features

- **App-password auth** — uses your Bluesky App Password via `BLUESKY_HANDLE` / `BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD` (shared with `@kud/bsky-cli`).
- **11 tools** — 5 read, 6 write.
- **Writes are gated** — every posting/engagement tool requires an explicit `confirm: true`, so an agent can never publish by accident.
- **Thin wrapper** — each tool is one line over `@kud/bsky`; the API logic lives in the core library, not here.
- **TypeScript, ESM, zero business logic** — `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` + `zod`.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A Bluesky account and an **App Password** (Settings → App Passwords)

### Installation

```sh
npx @kud/mcp-bsky
```

### Claude Desktop / Claude Code

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bsky": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@kud/mcp-bsky"],
      "env": {
        "BLUESKY_HANDLE": "you.bsky.social",

## 💬 Example Conversations

```
You: "What are people saying about the AT Protocol on Bluesky?"
AI: *calls search_posts → summarises the latest posts*

You: "Post 'shipped a new MCP server 🦋' to my Bluesky."
AI: *calls post with confirm: true → returns the post URL*

You: "Reply to that thread and like the original."
AI: *calls reply and like (confirm: true) → done*
```

## 🧪 Development

| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `npm run build`       | Compile TypeScript to `dist/`           |
| `npm run dev`         | Run from source via tsx                 |
| `npm test`            | Run the vitest suite                    |

export BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
npm run inspect:dev
```

## 🔐 Authentication

This server reads two environment variables — `@kud/bsky`'s contract, intentionally **not** `MCP_`-prefixed so the credentials are shared with `@kud/bsky-cli`:

1. Sign in at [bsky.app](https://bsky.app) → **Settings → App Passwords → Add App Password**.
2. Set `BLUESKY_HANDLE` (e.g. `you.bsky.social`) and `BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD` (the generated app password — never your main password).
