Browse GitHub PR review comments with fzf.

This is a GitHub CLI extension that lets you filter unresolved review threads for a pull request, preview comment context, copy a comment to your clipboard, or open it in the browser.

## 📦 Install

From a local checkout of this repo:

```
gh extension install .
```

Or directly from GitHub:

```
gh extension install kud/gh-pr-comments
```

## ▶️ Usage

```
gh pr-comments                 # infer repo and current PR
gh pr-comments <number>        # browse specific PR number
gh pr-comments -R owner/repo   # target a specific repository
```

Options:

- -a, --author Filter by author (can be repeated)
- -f, --file <path/regex> Filter by file path (repeatable)
- --since <YYYY-MM-DD> Filter comments created on/after date
- --until <YYYY-MM-DD> Filter comments created on/before date
- --all, --all-comments Show all comments in threads (not just latest)
- --include-outdated Include outdated comment threads
- --json Print parsed comments as JSON and exit
- --list Print UI list output and exit
- --resolved Show resolved threads instead of unresolved
- --sort <file|date|author> Sorting mode (default: file)
- --no-color Disable ANSI colors in UI/preview
- --debug Write a small debug summary file
- -R, --repo <owner/repo> Target a specific repository
- -h, --help Show help
- -v, --version Show version

Keybindings inside fzf:

- **Copy**: Enter / Ctrl-Y (full) • Ctrl-M (Markdown) • Ctrl-U (URL) • Ctrl-B (body)
- **Open**: Ctrl-O (browser) • Ctrl-E (editor at file:line)
- **Interact**: Ctrl-R (reply) • Ctrl-] (resolve) • Ctrl-\ (unresolve)
- **Toggles**: Alt-A (latest/all) • Alt-O (outdated) • Alt-R (state) • Alt-S (sort)
- **Help**: ? (toggle help overlay)
- **Filter**: Just start typing to filter by filename or author in real-time

## 🧰 Requirements

- gh, jq (>= 1.6), fzf
- awk, sed, base64, wc, tr, nl, cat, cut, rev, perl
- Optional: glow or mdcat for nicer markdown rendering
  - Clipboard: pbcopy (macOS) or xclip/xsel (Linux) for copy action

### Install requirements quickly

- macOS (Homebrew):

```
brew install gh jq fzf glow mdcat
```

Enable fzf key bindings (history search, Alt-C, etc.):

```
$(brew --prefix)/opt/fzf/install
```

Choose to enable key bindings and shell completion when prompted.

- Ubuntu/Debian:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y gh jq fzf xclip
# optional renderers: sudo apt install -y glow mdcat
```

- Fedora:

```
sudo dnf install -y gh jq fzf xclip
```

- Arch Linux:

```
sudo pacman -S --needed github-cli jq fzf xclip
```

Notes:

- On Linux, ensure `$HOME/.local/bin` is in your `PATH` so tools are discoverable.
- If your distro doesn’t package `gh`, install it via GitHub’s instructions: https://github.com/cli/cli#installation

WSL clipboard tips:

- This tool supports `pbcopy`, `xclip`, or `xsel` for copying.
- On WSL without X11, a quick shim is to add this to `~/.zshrc`:

```
pbcopy() { clip.exe; }
```

- Alternatively, install `xclip` and run an X server, or install `win32yank` and symlink it to `pbcopy`.

## 🧪 Testing locally

You can bypass live GitHub calls by providing a GraphQL result via the `GH_REVIEW_PR_JSON` env variable. This can be either a path to a file or the JSON string itself.

Example with your own GraphQL response file:

```
GH_REVIEW_PR_JSON=/path/to/your_graphql.json \
  ./gh-pr-comments 123 -R owner/repo --json
```

The above prints the parsed comments as JSON (use `--list` to print the UI list instead).

## 🎯 Workflow

**Pre-filter on launch** (command-line options):

- `-f src/app.py` — Filter by file path/regex (repeatable)
- `-a @alice` — Filter by author (repeatable)
- `--since 2024-01-01`, `--until 2024-01-31` — Filter by date range
- `--resolved` — Show resolved threads instead of unresolved
- Combine: `-f src -a @alice --since 2024-01-01`

**Filter in real-time** (inside fzf):

- Start typing to search by filename, author, or date
- Press **Ctrl-R** to refresh and fetch latest comments from GitHub
- Use **Alt-A** / **Alt-O** / **Alt-R** / **Alt-S** to toggle views

**Copy & Open**:

- **Enter** or **Ctrl-Y**: Copy full comment with context
- **Ctrl-M**: Copy as Markdown (great for responses)
- **Ctrl-O**: Open in browser
- **Ctrl-E**: Jump to file:line in your editor

## 🔎 Filtering tips

- File-first list: the UI list now starts with the file path for quick scanning.
- Filter by file: `-f src/app.py` can be repeated. Values are treated as regex by jq's `test(...)`, so you can use patterns like `-f '^src/.*\.py$'`.
- Filter by date: `--since 2024-01-01`, `--until 2024-01-31` (inclusive, UTC based on `createdAt`).
- Combine filters: `-f src -a @alice --since 2024-01-01 --include-outdated`.

Sorting and state:

- Sort: `--sort date` to sort by newest first; `--sort author` groups by author.
- Resolved: `--resolved` to browse resolved threads as a follow-up queue.

Color:

- Disable colors with `--no-color` or `NO_COLOR=1`.

## 📝 Notes

- By default, only the latest non-outdated comment of each unresolved thread is shown. Use `--all` to see every comment, and `--include-outdated` to include outdated threads.
- `--author` accepts either `user` or `@user`. `copilot` is normalized to `copilot-pull-request-reviewer`.
- If no unresolved comments are found, try `--all` or `--include-outdated`.
- On Linux, ensure `$HOME/.local/bin` is in your `PATH` so `fzf`/`jq` can be found.

## 🏷️ Versioning & Releases

This project follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer). Release workflow:

1. Determine the next version (e.g. `v0.1.1`) based on the changes (fix = patch, new backward‑compatible feature = minor, breaking change = major).
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with a new section for the version (include date):

```
## v0.1.1 - 2025-09-04
- Add ...
- Fix ...
```

3. Commit and tag:

```
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore(release): v0.1.1"
git tag v0.1.1
git push && git push --tags
```

Users can check the installed version with:

```
gh pr-comments --version
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **GitHub auth error**: If the API call fails, run `gh auth status` and `gh auth login`.
- **No comments found**: Try `--all`, `--include-outdated`, or `--resolved`. Also check filters like `--author`, `--file`, `--since/--until`.
- **Refresh (Ctrl-R) fails**: Check the error message in the preview pane. Common causes:
  - Not authenticated: run `gh auth status` and `gh auth login`
  - Network issues: ensure GitHub is reachable
  - If refresh shows an error, your old list is preserved automatically
- **Search/filter not working**: Just start typing in fzf - it searches across filenames, authors, and dates
- **Clipboard not working**: Install `pbcopy` (macOS), `xclip`/`xsel` (Linux). On WSL, add `pbcopy() { clip.exe; }` to your shell or install `win32yank`.
- **Colors look noisy**: Use `--no-color` or set `NO_COLOR=1`. Piping output? Prefer `--no-color`.
- **fzf not launching**: Ensure `fzf` is installed and your `TERM` is not `dumb` (use a real terminal). On macOS, run `$(brew --prefix)/opt/fzf/install` to enable key bindings.
- **jq version**: Requires jq >= 1.6 (for `fromdateiso8601`). Check with `jq --version` and upgrade if needed.
- **Markdown rendering**: If `glow`/`mdcat` are missing, plain text is shown. Install one for nicer previews.
- **Open in editor (Ctrl-E) does nothing**: Set the `EDITOR` env var, or ensure `code` is available for VS Code. Falls back to `vim`.
- **Large PRs**: Extremely long diff hunks are collapsed for performance in previews. Currently up to 100 comments per thread are fetched.
